# User Study Plan — Gaze vs. Joystick in VR/AR

## Objectives & Hypotheses
- Compare performance and usability between **gaze** and **joystick** target selection.
- H1 (Speed): Gaze yields faster selection times than joystick.
- H2 (Accuracy): Joystick yields fewer selection errors than gaze.
- H3 (Usability/Workload): SUS and NASA‑TLX differ across techniques.

## Variables
- IV: Interaction Technique ∈ {Gaze, Joystick} (within‑subjects).
- DVs: Task completion time (ms), Error count, SUS (0–100), NASA‑TLX subscales.

## Participants
- N = 10–16 adults; normal/corrected vision; no vestibular disorders.
- Record demographics and VR experience.

## Materials
- VR HMD (e.g., Meta Quest) + controller.
- Unity prototype with two modes and logging.
- Informed consent form; demographics; SUS; NASA‑TLX.

## Tasks
- Select highlighted targets that appear in random positions on a grid.
- Each condition: 2 practice trials + 20 recorded selections.

## Design & Counterbalancing
- Order counterbalanced (AB/BA). Assign participants alternately or via Latin square.

## Procedure (≈25–35 min per participant)
1) Welcome, consent, demographics (5 min)  
2) Headset fit, brief training (5 min)  
3) Block A: first technique — practice + 20 trials (7–10 min)  
4) SUS + NASA‑TLX for technique A (3–5 min)  
5) Short break (2 min)  
6) Block B: second technique — practice + 20 trials (7–10 min)  
7) SUS + NASA‑TLX for technique B (3–5 min)  
8) Debrief (2 min)

## Measures & Logging
- **Time:** per selection (ms) from target highlight to correct selection.
- **Errors:** mis‑selections or timeouts.
- **Questionnaires:** administer standard SUS and NASA‑TLX after each condition; follow official wording and scoring. (Do not alter item text.)

## Analysis Plan
- Compute per‑participant means; run **paired t‑tests** (time, error rate, SUS, NASA‑TLX).
- Report t, df, p, Cohen’s d. Use α=0.05; correct for multiple comparisons if needed.
- Visualize bar charts with error bars (95% CI).

## Ethics & Safety
- Inform participants of motion sickness risk; allow withdrawal at any time.
- Anonymize data; store locally; no PII in filenames.
